    message: "Hey Vader, have you tried Butterbeer? It's amazing!",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "Butterbeer? Is it strong enough to mask the taste of the Dark Side?",
  },
  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "It's not about strength, it's about flavor! What's your favorite Sith snack then?",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "I find your lack of appreciation for the Dark Side's culinary delights disturbing. I prefer something more ominous, like Death Star-shaped cookies.",
  },
  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "Death Star-shaped cookies sound intriguing! Do they explode with flavor?",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "They do, metaphorically. What about your world? Any magical meals worth mentioning?",

    name: "Harry Potter",
    message: "Absolutely! Ever tried Chocolate Frogs? They jump in your mouth!",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "Frogs? That sounds unsavory. However, I am curious about your Firewhisky. Is it as potent as it sounds?",

  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "Firewhisky is strong enough to make even dragons roar. Care to try some?",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "Perhaps another time. Tell me, Potter, do you have a favorite spell for cooking?",
  },
  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message: "Accio ingredients! It's quite handy when I'm feeling lazy.",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "Efficient, I'll give you that. In my realm, we rely more on precision and mastery. Do you duel over dinner as you do with wands?",
  },
  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "Not exactly dueling, but we do have feasts and celebrations. How about the Sith? Any grand banquets?",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "Only when the Emperor commands it. The Dark Side doesn't indulge in frivolous feasts. We prefer more... focused gatherings.",
  },
  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "I guess that explains your lean figure! Do you have any foods you miss from before you turned to the Dark Side?",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "There is one... Alderaanian spice pudding. It reminds me of a time before... before everything.",

  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "Food has a way of connecting us to memories. I hope you find a way to enjoy it again someday.",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message: "Thank you, Potter. Your sentimentality is... unexpected.",
  },
  {
    name: "Harry Potter",
    message:
      "Even Sith Lords deserve a good meal now and then. Perhaps one day we could share a Butterbeer.",
  },
  {
    name: "Darth Vader",
    message:
      "A curious proposition, Potter. Perhaps when the galaxy is less tumultuous.",
  },
